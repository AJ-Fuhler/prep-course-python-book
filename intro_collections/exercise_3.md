Differences between lists and tuples:
    1. lists are mutable, tuples are immutable
    2. lists are enclosed in brackets [ ], tuples with parentheses ( ) 

Similarities between lists and tuples:
    1. They are both sequences that maintain an ordered collection of objects,
    also known as elements, and use indexes to access those elements.
    2. They are both heterogeneous, meaning they can have different kind of
    objects.
