Product2
Product not found!

At the first function invocation, the argument that was passed ('113')
matches the second case, thus the function executes the block of code
associated with that case, which is print('Product2')

At the second function invocation, the argument that was passed (142)
only matches the default case. Since the argument is an integer, it does
not match the case '142', which is a string.
